PyGIRAFE stands for Python Graphical Interface to Run Analyses Flexibly and Easily

It's a Python graphical interface aimed for facilitating the analyses of data. 

Our goal is to provide an easy-to-use GUI that allows to load your data, filter them and fine-tuned your analyses parameters.

Any kind of data can be used after having configured a Python wrapper to link your data to GIRAFE interface.

You can select the data on which you want to run a given analysis, manually or using pre-set filters
while having the option to save groups of data for a quick access during future runs.

The toolbox was designed to be flexible. Thus adding a new analysis is done easily in a plugin way.

It is then possible to graphically set the parameters of the analysis, those set parameters
can be saved for a quick setting during future runs.

In order to improve reproducibility, two files are generated during the execution of each analysis:
a log file containing the text displayed on the prompt and a file containing the given parameters set
that can be used for a quick setting during future runs.

For a more pleasant experience, the GUI's skin can be configured
so the images of your choice will appeared on the background.

PyGIRAFE is under development. The version published is an alpha version and the documentation is still not complete.
Don't hesitate to contact us if you want more information.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation of PyGIRAFE will be soon available at this address `here <https://pygirafe.readthedocs.io/>`_.

---------------
Personalisation
---------------

To create a new analysis wrapper:
Create a class that inherit from GirafeAnalysisFormatWrapper

To get new option to group data, implement the static function grouped_by() in your analysis wrapper

To implement new analysis, create classes that inherit GirafeAnalysis.

Then in config.yaml indicate with the variable data_files_dir_names then the DATA_FORMAT (replace by the name of your data_format)

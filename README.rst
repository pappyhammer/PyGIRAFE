PyGIRAFE stands for Python Graphical Interface to Run Analyses Flexibly and Easily

It's a Python graphical interface aimed for facilitating the analyses of data. 

Our goal is to provide an easy-to-use GUI that allows to load your data, filter them and fine-tuned your analyses parameters. 

The analysis parameters are easy to set through our GUI and can be saved and re-used any time.
Each time, a log file and all parameters are saved to improve reproducibility.

The toolbox was designed to be flexible. Thus adding a new analysis is done easily in a plugin way.

Different formats of data can be added easily, as we used a wrapper system.

PyGIRAFE is under development. The version published is an alpha version and the documentation is still not complete.
Don't hesitate to contact us if you want more information.
